## **🧑‍💻 Who Is This For?**

Ideal for **traders, tax professionals, and investors** managing multiple brokerage accounts who need a faster, automated way to consolidate and analyze their **1099-B tax forms**.

## **🎉 Why I Built This**

After the success of **[Auto-StockTrader](https://github.com/Prem-ium/Auto-StockTrader)**, I realized managing tax forms across multiple accounts and brokerages was a challenge. My accountant even recommended filing for an extension due to the large number of 1099 tax forms, a result of the primary investment strategy used by users of my Auto-StockTrader repository. Additionally, some accountants charge hefty fees—$50-75 per additional tax form. **TaxMerge** was created to tackle this issue; it aims to simplify this process, particularly in calculating the final short and long-term net realized gains/losses for a tax year.
